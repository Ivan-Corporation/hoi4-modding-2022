#### Setup for Blender (2.83+)
* Start Blender and open the `User Preferences` panel.  
* Switch to the `Add-ons` tab and select `Install Add-on from file`. Pick the zip file you have downloaded.  
* Tick the checkbox to enable the add-on and you should see a new tab in the `Sidebar` of the `3D View`. (`View > Sidebar` if you have it closed)  
* The `Sidebar` will now have a `PDX Blender Tools` tab.
