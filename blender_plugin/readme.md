## IO PDX MESH
This project aims to allow editing of mesh and animation files used in the various [Clausewitz Engine games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_Development_Studio#List_of_games_developed) created by [Paradox Development Studios](https://www.paradoxplaza.com) It's designed to run in *both* Maya (2018+) and Blender (2.83+).

### Installation
#### Setup for Maya (2018+)
* Go to your Maya user scripts path. (eg on Windows: `C:\Users\...\Documents\maya\scripts`)  
* Extract the contents of the zip file directly into this path.  
* Start Maya and change the `Command Line` to Python by clicking the label.  
* Then use the command `import io_pdx_mesh;reload(io_pdx_mesh)` to launch the tool.  
* You can highlight this command and use the middle-mouse button to drag it into a shelf button to save it.  
* The tool window will now open.

#### Setup for Blender (2.83+)
* Start Blender and open the `User Preferences` panel.  
* Switch to the `Add-ons` tab and select `Install Add-on from file`. Pick the zip file you have downloaded.  
* Tick the checkbox to enable the add-on and you should see a new tab in the `Sidebar` of the `3D View`. (`View > Sidebar` if you have it closed)  
* The `Sidebar` will now have a `PDX Blender Tools` tab.
